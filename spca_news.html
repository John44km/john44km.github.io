         <h3>Newsletters</h3>
         <p>SPCA NOVA publishes our print newsletter, Paws and Effect, twice a year. We also send out an e-newsletter, A Brief Paws, once or twice a year. Our newsletters enable us to tell stories about the cats and dogs we rescue. They also provide us an opportunity to share our knowledge about issues that may help you care for your own cats and dogs. We hope our stories inspire you to join us in helping cats, dogs and people in our community.</p>
         <p>Past print newsletters are available to read via PDF. Our e-newsletter and select print newsletter stories are available to read online.</p>
