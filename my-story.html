    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>Laslty, I love ted talks and podcasts and they always gives me inspiration. This ted talked specifically, inspired me and pushed me to keep fighting for my dreams becuase the speaker, Ms. Gilbert had many failures and never gave up. She taught me to never give up and always keep fighting for what you beleive in.</p>
