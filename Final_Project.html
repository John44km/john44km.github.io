<h2>Reflection/Synopsis</h2>
         <p>I created this site for my final project, to show all that I have learned in SMAD 307. During this class I learned how to code HTML and CSS as well as how to use bootstrap and github. After learning bootstrap, I was able to may make a user-friendly navigation, create buttons that link to other pages, and cards to visualize potential adoption candidates. Other essentials that I learned and incorporated into my site included jumbotron css. Instead of making individual changes in html, I was able to use css to make a design change that would change all the pages and the jumbotron feature helped highlight whichever page the user is on.</p>
         <p>As for the project I chose SPCA of Northern Virginia because I love animals, and I love the work that they do but, when looking at their site I found it not to be appealing. This then led me to choose their website to redesign in order to make it more aesthetically pleasing as well as user friendly. In my opinion, they had to many pages making it hard to answer my questions as well as the color scheme that was chosen did not fit their overall goal. That is why when I chose the design for my website, I chose more neutral colors, with a bright red button to stand out for donations. I also looked at their international site and found that they looked completely different and felt that the NoVa site should replicate more with their international site. That is why I used their international site as inspiration. For example, the international site has a homepage that is very eye catching using a large graphic image; that is why I chose to use an image I found as the main center point for my homepage. The other graphic images I used were found on the NoVa website, under their available adoptions. I screenshotted their photos and used them to show the available cats and dogs with bootstrap making cards. They had no videos on their site, so when creating my website, I felt that videos were not needed because the photos speak a thousand words. For the layout, I had drawn out multiple different ways the website could function. after considering all my options I decided to go with a minimalistic approach. Every page has all the information that is needed by being taken from the original site, while the extra pages in the original site that were not important were taken out to clear space. At the top of each page I also used jumbotron from bootstrap that I learned about to make each page clear to the user.</p>
         <p>Before this class I would never would have thought I could code a website, but here we are. From learning how to use WordPress in SMAD 203, to now making a fully functional website by code, Iâ€™m very amazed and feel very proud. I now have built a personal website with a portfolio of all my work including this site.</p>
