    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>Throughout high school, I learned how to manage my time by working various jobs, playing a sport, acting as head designer for school newspaper, and continuing my education. While heading the design team on my school newspaper, we were invited to attend Columbia University for their annual Columbia Scholastic Press Association event and crown awards. Since graduating high school, I am now curently furthering my education at James Madison Univ. as a junior studying media arts and design. During high school I fell in love working with adobe products and design elements, so I knew this major and career path was perfect for me. At JMU, I am member of a sorority, Tri Delta. Our philanthropy, St. Jude, stands close to my heart as we raise money and support the children's hospital. Each year we try to raise between $50,000-$100,000 through events we host throughout the year. I love to be active and always have a positive attitude and hope to further my work experiences by broadening my horizon, and taking on new challenges.
