    <h2> Profile</h2>
    <p>Throughout high school I learned to manage my time so I could hold a job and further my education. In high school, I was one of the head editors for the school newspaper and was in the Academic National Honor Society. When not working or doing school work, I played soccer for Loudoun Soccer. Since graduating, I am furthering my education by attending James Madison Univ. where I am currently a sophmore studying media arts and design. At JMU, I am member of a sorority, Tri Delta. Our philanthropy, St. Jude, stands close to my heart as we raise money and support the childerens hospital. Each year we try to raise between $50,000-$100,000 through events we host throughout the year. I love to be active and always have a positive attitude and hope to further my work experiences by broadening my horizon, and taking on new challenges.
