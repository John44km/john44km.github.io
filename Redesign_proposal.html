         <h3>Overview and Audience</h3>
         <p>When looking for a website to redesign, I wanted to find one that I have interest in. Having interest in the subject I believe will make me work harder and try to redesign it to the best of my ability. That is why I have chosen an animal rescue organization called, SPCA of Northern Virginia, to redesign their website. First off, I was looking at SPCA International website and found that their website has many more resources and promoted many different user experiences while the northern VA website was very bland and had nothing to grab my attention (comparison will be shown down below). As well as, SPCA NOVA had a lot of links to the point that I got lost and felt they could be combined or have drop downs to decrease the amount of links I had to go through to find what I could be possibly looking for. Another aspect of the website that caught my eye were the colors, they used green and blue primarily with a hint of pink that I felt did not help enhance the website. I believe because SPCA NOVA is a sister website, I feel that when redesigning the site, I want mine to resemble the international website, so I will use the international website as inspiration. As for the audience I believe the website should pertain to those who love animals and those who want to help. To be more precise, I think the audience should relate to those who want to donate, volunteer, and adopt because the website is a non-profit animal rescue organization.</p>
