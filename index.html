         <h2>About</h2>

     <p>This website was designed to enhance my knowledge on using html and creating micro-sites. Along with this site, in 307, I have leanred about git hub and more design techniques with css and html.</p>

     <p>My hope for this micro-site is to design it with sleek aestichs and easy userbility. I decided on more... colors.... and wants my tabs/pages to be in a .... location .... </p>
