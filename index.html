         <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Welcome to Design by Creativity! My name is Katie Johnson, I'm a junior at James Madison University. I created this website to showcase my work and create a site that can help employers and others learn who I am as a person. The main reason I use a website to showcase my work is due to my love for design and passion for creation. I let my imagination run wild thus the name, Design by Creativity.</p>
         <p> As you make your way through my site you will find my biography, resume, and portfolio. If you would like to reach me my contact information will be provided down below.</p>
