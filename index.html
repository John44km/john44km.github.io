         <h2>About</h2>

    <p>Welcome to Design by Creativity! My name is Katie Johnson, I'm a sophmore at James Madison University. I created this website to showcase my work and create a site that can help employers and others learn who I am. The whole reason I use a website to showcase my work is because I love to design and create many things. I let my imagination run wild thus the name, Design by Creativity.</p>
         <p> As you make your way thorugh my site you will find my biography, resume, and a page full of my projects and creations. I hope you like what you see and I hope one day my name will be passed around, and I will have people asking for me to help them. The two things that make me happiest is being creative with photography/design and helping others!</p>
