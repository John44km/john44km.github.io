 <h3>Dog Adoption Policies</h3>
<p>Please read our adoption policies below. They are designed to ensure the health and safety of our dogs and the compatibility of the dog(s) with their adoptive family.
    Note: We ONLY adopt to residents of the Washington metropolitan area, which includes Washington, D.C., and parts of Northern Virginia and Maryland.</p>
         <h4>What is the Adoption Fee?</h4>
         <p>The adoption fee is $325 per dog.</p>
         <ul>
             <li>This fee helps cover our costs for medical expenses, spaying/neutering, obedience training and boarding.</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Conditions</h4>
         <p>Please note that we will not place a dog in a home if any of the following conditions are present:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>he prospective home currently has an un-spayed or un-neutered cat or dog.</li>
             <li>The dog will be left outside when no one is home.</li>
             <li>The dog is intended as a gift.</li>
             <li>Puppies less than 6 months old will not be placed in homes:</li>
             <li>with children under 4 years of age, or</li>
             <li>where no one is home during the day.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Once placed, we reserve the right to check on the dog at any time to ensure the dog’s well-being. If any condition of the Adoption Contract has been violated, or if SPCA NOVA believes that the environment is unsafe, we reserve the right to remove the dog from the home.</p>
         <p>If at any time you cannot keep the dog, you must return the dog to the SPCA NOVA and not to another individual, rescue organization or shelter.</p>
         <h4>Selection</h4>
         <p>It is important that you consider the following:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Size – If you rent, does your apartment or home have stated size limits? (Landlord approval is required). Have you considered what size of dog best suits your available space and lifestyle?</li>
             <li>Age – Dogs of different ages have very different requirements, make sure you know what these are (i.e. puppies and older dogs require extra care and attention).</li>
             <li>Temperament – Does the dog have a temperament that would be suitable for your family?</li>
             <li>Compatibility – Is the dog recommended for children and other pets?</li>
             <li>Energy level – Does your schedule allow for providing the amount of exercise recommended?</li>
             <li>Special needs – Will the dog require special care?</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Spay/Neuter</h4>
         <p>All dogs over the age of 6 months old will be spayed/neutered prior to adoption. If the dog is under the age of 6 months, an additional spay/neuter fee will be charged, and you will be given a certificate for the surgery.</p>
         <h4>Obedience Training</h4>
         <p>Prior to adoption, our dogs get crate training and learn basic commands, which makes the transition into your home much smoother. We encourage our adopters to continue obedience training.</p>
