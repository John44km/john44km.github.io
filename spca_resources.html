    <p class="lead">There are a lot of resources on the internet about the health and behavior of cats and dogs. The SPCA of Northern Virginia, based on our years of experience, has compiled information on the following topics.</p>

         <h3>Behavioral Assistance</h3>
         <h4>Personalized Behavioral Assistance</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Companion Animal Behavior – Cats and dogs</li>
             <li>North American Feline Behavior Outreach Services – Phone consultations for cats</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Licensed Veterinary Behaviorists in Northern Virginia and Maryland</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Dr. Leslie Sinn, DVM, DACVB, Behavior Solutions for Pets</li>
             <li>Dr. Marsha Reich, DVM, DACVB, Maryland-Virginia Veterinary Behavioral Consulting, 301-384-3900</li>

         </ul>
         <h3>Tips on Finding Credible Pet Health Information Online</h3>
         <p>With the amount of information on the web, finding credible online sources for pet health and behavior can be tricky. Well-meaning individuals launch their own websites offering unfounded medical or behavioral advice for pets, and search results direct users to sites where anyone can ask and answer a question.</p>
         <p>We recommend using online resources to supplement information you get from a trusted veterinarian, along with what you know from experience.  If your cat or dog experiences worrisome and/or persistent symptoms, the best approach is to:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Talk with your vet (and, where appropriate, get a second opinion);</li>
             <li>Search for online resources from reputable organizations or institutions, and use more than one source to gauge differences of opinion;</li>
             <li>Talk to experienced friends or coworkers; and</li>
             <li>Listen to yourself based on what you know about your own cat/dog. When your cat/dog is exhibiting unusual behavior, you often know that something is wrong even when it can be challenging to figure out what is wrong and what the appropriate treatment is.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Found a Cat or Dog?</h3>
         <h4>Cats</h4>
         <p>SPCA NOVA gives priority to rescuing friendly stray cats living outdoors after working with the person contacting us to determine the cat appears to be lost or abandoned. For example:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>When the person knows the cat was abandoned after a neighbor moved away.</li>
             <li>After the person has reported the cat to the local shelter (note: many local shelters will not take in stray cats).</li>
             <li>After the person has reached out to neighbors – via hanging signs in the neighborhood or posting a message on online social media (e.g., NextDoor.com) – to help determine the cat is lost or abandoned.</li>
             <p>Note: Our ability to rescue any cat depends on you helping us, and having a foster home available to care for the cat. If the cat is sick or injured, we will do our best to take the cat in right away.</p>
         </ul>
         <h4>Dogs</h4>
         <p>SPCA NOVA does not take in stray dogs. If you see a dog loose in your neighborhood you should:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Reach out to neighbors via social media (e.g., NextDoor.com) to see if you can find the dog’s owner.</li>
             <li>If the dog is friendly, you may want to put the dog on a leash and/or find a way to secure the dog (e.g., fenced yard) in case a neighbor is easily located.</li>
             <li>Report the dog to your local animal shelter/animal control.</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Reporting Stray Cats and Dogs to Local Shelters</h4>
         <p>To report a stray cat or dog, contact your local animal control. Many shelters allow you to report stray dogs or cats online.</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Animal Welfare League of Alexandria</li>
             <li>Animal Welfare League of Arlington</li>
             <li>City of Fairfax Animal Shelter</li>
             <li>Fairfax County Animal Shelter</li>
             <li>Loudoun County Animal Shelter</li>
             <li>Manassas Animal Adoption Center</li>
             <li>Prince William County Animal Shelter</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Reporting Animal Neglect and Abuse</h3>
         <h4>Take Action If You Are Concerned</h4>
         <p>If you are concerned about an animal’s well-being or want to report potential abuse or neglect please, contact your local animal control agency for the county you live in or the county where the concern is taking place.</p>
         <p>Don’t be shy about reporting your concerns, and ask how you can be updated about  the results of an inquiry or investigation. As a resident and taxpayer, you have the right to have your concerns heard and to learn more about the situation.</p>
         <p>If you don’t get results after contacting your local animal control office, contact your local city or county elected representative.</p>

         <h4>What Is Spay Inc.?</h4>
         <p>Spay Inc. is a program of the SPCA of Northern Virginia that provides discounted spay and neuter referrals for dogs and cats in Northern Virginia. We work with a network of participating hospitals to offer affordable spay/neuter surgeries.

         <h4>Need Help Getting Your Pet Spayed or Neutered?</h4>
         <p>To obtain a low-cost spay/neuter referral in the Northern Virginia area, simply fill out our online request form. We will answer any questions you have about the program and help you select a participating veterinary hospital or clinic in your area.</p>
         <p>Everyone qualifies to participate in the Spay Inc. Program – there are no income or residency requirements. If you don’t live in Northern Virginia or the surrounding areas and need information about spay/neuter programs in your city or state, check out one or more of the national databases that allow you to search by zip code.</p>
         <p>You may also contact us by email or leave us a voice message by phone. Please include your name, address, daytime and evening phone numbers, the best time to reach you, and details about your pet(s), such as breed, age, and gender.</p>
         <h4>Why Spay/Neuter?</h4>
         <p>Having your pets spayed or neutered, preferably before their first heat cycle, has many benefits for you, your pet, and your community.</p>
         <h4>Benefits for You</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>You’ll avoid female pets’ messy heat cycles.</li>
             <li>You won’t have pets trying to run away in search of a mate.</li>
             <li>You’re less likely to have stray animals howling outside your windows because they can tell an animal is in heat inside.</li>
             <li>You won’t have litters of puppies or kittens to care for.</li>
             <li>You won’t have the veterinary bills that come with a pregnant female and her subsequent litters.</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Benefits for Your Pet</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Spayed/neutered pets are usually healthier and happier.</li>
             <li>By reducing the urge to breed, your pets’ desires to roam in search of a mate are reduced – some studies say by up to 90 percent. Roaming cats and dogs are likely to encounter dangerous roads, cars, diseases, and fights with other animals.</li>
             <li>Spaying your female dog or cat eliminates the possibility of ovarian and uterine cancers, pyometra (bacterial infection of the uterus), and greatly reduces the incidence of mammary gland tumors.</li>
             <li>Neutering your male dog or cat prevents testicular tumors – the second most common tumor in male dogs.</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Benefits for Your Community</h4>
         <ul>
             <li>Millions of unwanted puppies and kittens are born in our country each year, but there are not enough homes for all of these youngsters (in addition to the millions of adult cats and dogs surrendered to animal shelters), which means many get euthanized.</li>
             <li>Spaying/neutering your pets reduces the number of homeless and stray pets in your neighborhood, as well as those entering your local animal shelters.</li>
             <li>The best and simplest solution to the pet overpopulation problem is to spay and neuter your pets.</li>
         </ul>
