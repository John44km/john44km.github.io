            <h1>My Portfolio</h1>

            <p>This webpage consists of many projects I have done, what I have learned, as well as photography taken around the country.</p>

            //...Incorporate at least 5 original images, graphics, and/or video files (self-created). Use a digital camera (either your own or one from SMAD). These might be unrelated photos that showcase your creative work or you may create a photo essay with a series of photos that tell a story. Consider opportunities for captions, thumbnails, and animation....//

            <p>Before taking SMAD 302, I took SMAD 203 which was an introduction class. In the class, I started to learn brackets and also learned how to use wordpress for my final project I made a wordpress site that shows all my accomplishments from that class as well as my ability to use wordpress to create the site listed below.
