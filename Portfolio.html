            <h1>My Portfolio</h1>

            <p>First and foremost, this website is a piece of my portfolio. I used HTML and css in brackets to code this website and then linked it to github.</p>



            <h2>Recreation of a website</h2>
             <p>During one of my classes, I had to find a website that I felt was not user friendly and recreate it in order to make it user friendly as well as showcase my experience of HTML and CSS. To find the website click <a href="spca_index.html">here.</a></p>

            <h2>Logo Design</h2>
            <p>While attending JMU I was given the oppoturnity to work with a non-profit organization that wanted to start their own coffee shop. I was able to get experience working with a client and practice my skills on adobe illustrator in order to design them a logo. Down below you will see the final logo I presented as well as my brand guidelines.</p>
